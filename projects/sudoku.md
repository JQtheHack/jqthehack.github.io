Sudoku solver is a Java project I created while I was taking ICS 211 in 2022. The most challenging portion of developing the program was trying to implement the algorithm used that would solve the problem. This project was one of the many challenging programs I had to develop and introduced an interesting challenge in implementing a program with many different components.
