Sudoku Solver is a Java project I created while taking ICS 211 in 2022. The most challenging part of developing the program was implementing the algorithm used to solve the problem. This project was one of the many challenging programs I had to develop and helped me develop stronger problem-solving skills.

The numerous functioning parts forced me to really connect all the components together and really come up with a cohesive and efficient solution. I learned more about the intricacies of programming larger projects which also helped me naturally improve my coding practices.
