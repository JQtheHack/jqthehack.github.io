Sudoku Solver is a Java project I created while taking ICS 211 in 2022. The most challenging part of developing the program was implementing the algorithm used to solve the problem. This project was one of the many challenging programs I had to develop and helped me develop stronger problem-solving skills. However, this was my first real introduction into how in programming, you have to go through many challenges in order to find fixes and implement concepts into actual code that functions. Additionally, I learned how to create tests that check for different components and how crucial it is to make sure each component works. Similiar to a car, if one part works, it can damage or hamper other parts.

The numerous functioning components in this project forced me to really connect everything together and really come up with a cohesive and efficient solution. I learned more about the intricacies of programming larger projects which also helped me naturally improve my coding practices that I am able to apply to this day. This project was hard, but I learned a lot of things that helped build good habits.
