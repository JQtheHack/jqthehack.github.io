The calculator app is a small individual project I developed as part of my coursework during ICS 212 in Spring 2023. This program is a basic calculator that implements fundamental mathematical operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The project helped me reinforce the syntax for C and become more proficient in the language. As a result, I can feel comfortable applying concepts and ideas precisely in the language. Additionally, I also learned that C is much more challenging to program in than Java. I found the challenge to be fun, and I was able to improve my ability to program in another language other than Java. Also, I found that it wasn't too bad to be able to switch languages and that the main thing to keep in mind is the programming concepts that all languages share. If you understand that, you can program with anything by converting syntax or using the internet to figure out how to implement what you want to code.
