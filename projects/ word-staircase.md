Word Staircase is a very basic project as a part of my courseload in ICS 212 in the Spring 2023 semester. The program in essence just manipulates a string you give it in different ways, such as applying lowercase, uppercase, or togglecase to the string and creating a staircase pattern with it.

In this project I gained a stronger sense of how methods work and how to implement them in a practical manner. Having practiced the different use cases for these methods, I gained the ability to recognize when I can add them to any future projects.
