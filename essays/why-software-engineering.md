## Why

Software Engineering has always been something that I can comfortably do. I always felt that this is the path I would take since all the way back to middle school, which was the time I began programming at the age of 14. However, despite me starting at a young age, it was never a story of finding a passion of mine and wanting to pursue it, but a story of me finding what I wanted my career to be and what I was content with being.  

## My Interests in Tech

Despite my seeming indifference, I do find certain parts of tech and programming interesting. I like how the environment is always changing and evolving constantly. The chaos is something that appeals to me, as there's always a sense of opportunity and something new you can learn and discover. 

Growing up, I have always been witness to technology changing rapidly around me. I remember seeing the introductions of smartphones when I was a child, and seeing how quickly it improved in only a decade! Seeing this and how much the landscape in tech changes, I want to be closer to it, much like a child yearning to see the fireworks. I want to see the future advancements in tech as closely I can.

## AI

As it stands now, my goal is to see the growing expansion and integration of AI. I believe it's going to be the next big thing in terms of exponentially revolutionizing the world we live in, and I want to just gather as much knowledge as I can about it going into the future. ChatGPT blew my mind the first time I used it, because it just felt like 'magic'. I have always watched afar when it came to changes in tech, but now, I have the opportunity and ability to finally work with it.

## Going Forward

Currently, my goal right now is to get my degree at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and ideally land a job at a top tech company (such as Google) developing software. I'd like to work with other incredible engineers on many different projects and hopefully, embark on my own journey in developing tech. Ultimately, Software Engineering is a career that just fits for me.
