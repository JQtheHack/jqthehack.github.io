<h2 id="to-sharpen-a-blade">To Sharpen a Blade</h2>

<p>Blacksmithing is a craft as old as time. In this ancient and revered craft, there is much to learn. This art requires an incredible eye for precision as well as the necessary patience to think carefully about the shape they want to create despite 
enduring sweltering flames. An expert blacksmith must stick to tried and true processes as well as gauging when to apply their intuition for every single strike. The process is exhausting and stressful, yet they are able to produce a stunning blade 
capable of slicing through anything with razor-sharp precision.</p>

<h2 id="design-processes-and-efficiency">Design Processes and Efficiency</h2>

<p>With every strike of a hammer, an expert blacksmith is following a pattern to turn a piece of iron into a sharp, equal sided blade. The blacksmith must carefully apply various techniques and skills otherwise they may crack the iron. Without these 
trained techniques, the blades they create may never be so beautiful.</p>

<p>Likewise, it is the same in software engineering. Design patterns are a way of creating a process that’s efficient in minimizing the problems while optimizing the process which smooths out the flow of development. Like the precise art of 
blacksmithing, design patterns bridges communication from the expert to the novice in the right way. There is a key set of best practices and knowledge necessary to create well-structured, functional software. Efficiency is built upon a diligent practice as well as textbook technique.</p>

<p>Therefore, design patterns are an essential piece in the software development process. They encourage quality technique which results in easy, repeatable solutions to problems based in design related problems. The end result is like a sharpened sword. Clear, well-developed, and easy to maintain.</p>

<h2 id="personal-experiences-with-design-patterns">Personal Experiences with Design Patterns</h2>

<p>This is my first time learning about design patterns, so I’m not very familiar with actively using them in projects before. However, looking back at it, I have unknowingly used design patterns many times over the semester and in different courses.</p>

<p>Singleton: This pattern is primarily for ensuring a single instance of a class, and I have most certainly done this in Java as a way to simplify the project and the code.
Observer: I have used this when working with event handlers since they observe and notify when an event occurs.</p>

<p>I think design patterns are definitely useful, and that they’ll help me in the future to be more thoughtful while I develop software and to hopefully be more efficient.</p>
