JavaScript was the first language in which I dabbled in a class setting. At the time, I was a senior in high school, and I had just found joy in programming on Code.org, the website that my AP Computer Science Principles teacher wanted us to use. I continued to dabble in web development until 2021 where I promptly, forgot everything.

Two years later, and here I am, desperately trying to relearn everything in the language so I can pass this course and prepare my technical skills for a job. While there were many concepts I recognized instantly in the language, such as for loops and switch statements, there are also many things I don't know, such as the Promise syntax, rest parameters, and the many other clever things you can do.



## Javascript: Is it Good or Bad?

In my opinion, I believe JavaScript is a good language to introduce someone to the world of programming, simply because of how easy and flexible it is to use. Looking back, I think that's why my computer science teacher in high school chose to start us off with this language.

Software Engineering is defined as a kind of engineering approach to software development, emphasizing systematic application. Loosely speaking, it applies the key aspects of the engineering process to software, including elements such as design, collaboration, testing, and analysis. These processes are crucial for a software engineer, as well as the focus needed to persist throughout the entire process. I believe JavaScript is a versatile language that complements the  developers.

## A WOD?

A WOD, or a Workout of the Day, is basically like being given a coding problem for a given time frame. I think this is an incredibly effective way of teaching. Often times, when you are in a programming class, you are given assignments outside of class time to do. In our increasingly busy lives, we can at times be lethargic and not have the time or will to do programming. When you combine this wtih all the supertools we have for programming, (StackOverflow & Github Copilot) students will absolutely utilize these tools as a crutch, ultimately impeding their learning. 

The brilliance of a WOD comes in the simple, but effective form of deliberate practice. In a given time period, you must complete a coding problem. You are given as much time and help to prepare, and the idea is you hopefully come in focused and determined to not fail this course and pass the WOD.

## Takeaway

In the end, I find Athletic Software Egnineering to be an effective way to push me to do better. I appreciate work and focus this course requires out of you, and rewards you for. I will try to do my best, because this is personally the approach that I believe in.
