Javascript was the first language that I dabbled in a class setting. At the time, I was a senior in high school and I found just found joy in programming on Code.org, the website my AP Computer Science Principle teacher wanted us to use. I continued to dabble with web development until 2021, where I promptedly, forgot everything. 

Two years later, and here I am trying to desperately relearn everything in the language so I can pass this course and prepare my technical skills to get a job. There are many concepts that I recognize instantly in the language like for loops and switch statements, but there are also many things I don't know, such as the Promise Syntax, Rest Parameters, and many other clever things you can do.

## Javascript: Is it Good or Bad?

In my opinion, I think Javascript is a good language to introduce someone to the world of programming simply because of how easy and flexible it is to use. In hindsight, with my limited knowledge of the language, I believe that's why my computer science teacher in high school started us off with this language. 

Software Engineering is defined an a kind of engineering approach on software development of a systematic application. Loosely speaking, it is the application of the major aspects of the engineering process, but on software. Key elements such as: design, collaboration, testing, and analysis. These processes are critical for a software engieer as well the focus to persist throughout the process. And I think Javascript is a diverse language that helps complement the developer.

## A WOD?

A WOD, or a Workout of the Day, is basically like being given a coding problem for a given time frame. I think this an incredibly effective way of teaching. Often times, when your in a programming class, you are given assignments outside of class time to do. In our increasingly busy lives, we can at times be lethargic and not have the time or will to do programming. When you combine this wtih all the supertools we have for programming, (StackOverflow & Github Copilot) students will absolutely utilize these tools as a crutch at a detriment to their learning. 

The brilliance of a WOD comes in the simple, but effective form of deliberate practice. In a given time period, you have to finish a coding problem. You are given as much time and help to prepare, and the idea is you hopefully come in focused, and determined to not fail this course and pass the WOD.

## Takeaway

In the end, I find Athletic Software Egnineering to be an effective way to push me to do better. I appreciate work and focus this course requires out of you, and rewards you for. I will try to do my best, because this is personally the approach that I believe in.
