<h2 id="i-introduction">I Introduction</h2>

<p>AI is the future. Although it is still in its infancy, it has the potential to be used to greatly enhance learning and understanding. However, though it is a powerful tool for learning, it is equally a powerful crutch that can severely hamper a
students learning by doing tasks for them. Tools I’ve used like ChatGPT and Co-Pilot are immensely useful for learning concepts and basics, but when it comes down to applying them into real projects, it becomes much more complicated.</p>

<h2 id="ii-personal-experience-with-ai">II Personal Experience with AI</h2>

<p>Personally, I have tried to use AI as much as I could. I experimented with its ability to perform on WODS, essays, and on homework. I have found that it’s strength as a tool is logarithmic. Its greatest ability is to do the small things easily, and 
while that may on paper be a good reason to use it, what will you do when the courses get harder and the applications get too condensed? What will you do when the AI won’t give you exactly what you want? Using AI is like building a house on sand. 
If you don’t spend the time properly learning the material, everything you try to build on top of it will fall apart. Nothing will stand if you didn’t at first try and that is why AI is my tutor rather than a cheating partner.</p>

<h3 id="1-experience-wods">1. Experience WODs</h3>

<p>When it came to practice WODs, they didn’t really help at all with generating code that could help me with the assignment. Rather, if there’s a question I needed about the code or a general question, I felt that it was quite useful. In the end, 
just looking over the screencast is better because they translate to the In-class WODs.</p>

<h3 id="2-in-class-practice-wods">2. In-class Practice WODs</h3>

<p>I felt that in a practice context, they were hit or miss. Either they’d generate code that was useful or not. I preferred watching and going through the screencasts then looking through the practice WOD because it was much easier to translate 
skills than to use chatGPT and get a different solution and different way of doing things. The tradeoff is too significant.</p>

<h3 id="3-in-class-wods">3. In-class WODs</h3>

<p>When it came to the WODs, I felt that they made it too easy to pass them with chatGPT. However, as the course progressed, that no longer became the case. There came a point where you’d spend more time trying to get the damn thing to work compared 
to just practicing and getting it done easily and stress-free. I felt that the WODs were purposely designed to make chatGPT nearly useless which discouraged students to not use it as a crutch because they can’t use it as a crutch anyway.</p>

<h3 id="4-essays">4. Essays</h3>

<p>I tried initially to write with chatGPT because it seemed like it did a good job of making a good essay, however it has no voice whatsoever, otherwise it is boring to read. Additionally, I took more time to use it which made it not worth using at 
all. Me submitting a rough draft is both faster and better at conveying my ideas. AI’s only edge is fixing grammar and making a more academic paper.</p>

<h3 id="5-final-project">5. Final project</h3>

<p>It depends on the use case. If it’s generating code, not likely useful. If it’s for debugging and breaking through points where you are stuck it’s immensely useful.</p>

<h3 id="6-learning-a-concept--tutorial">6. Learning a concept / tutorial</h3>

<p>If your stuck on something, oftentimes its a gap in knowledge that isn’t getting across thtough you from a video or reading. ChatGPT allows you to endlessly question it until you get something that helps you. When it comes to learning, it is 
second to none at getting past these obstacles.</p>

<h3 id="7-answering-a-question-in-class-or-in-discord">7. Answering a question in class or in Discord</h3>

<p>Not useful. This course is too specific and nuanced for a general purpose AI like chatGPT. Relying on the previous experience of others as well as the professors is simply unmatched since they know the course and challenges.</p>

<h3 id="8-asking-or-answering-a-smart-question">8. Asking or answering a smart-question</h3>

<p>I think in this case it’s useful. The extra fluff chatGPT provides can actually help you better articulate and pinpoint what you want to ask. However, when it comes to answering a question it really depends on the point your at in the course 
because it’s only useful up to a certain point.</p>

<h3 id="9-coding-example">9. Coding example</h3>

<p>No AI really. Coding examples were often unhelpful further in the course.</p>

<h3 id="10-explaining-code">10. Explaining code</h3>

<p>As for personally explaining code, it is better to not use AI since people mostly want to hear your ideas and thoughts on the code. If they wanted more, THEY can use AI to fill in the gaps.</p>

<h3 id="11-writing-code">11. Writing code</h3>

<p>Not really useful on more complicated applications. AI was only useful for really writing small bits of code you didn’t feel like finding through StackOverflow or Google.</p>

<h3 id="12-documenting-code">12. Documenting code</h3>

<p>Not particularly useful for generating documentation. The generated text isn’t really useful at explaining the useful insights you would want.</p>

<h3 id="13-quality-assurance">13. Quality assurance</h3>

<p>I think it only helps with finding error in code rather than ensuring quality. That’s the job for ESLint.</p>

<h3 id="14-other-uses-in-ics-314-not-listed">14. Other uses in ICS 314 not listed</h3>

<p>n/a</p>

<h2 id="iii-impact-on-learning-and-understanding">III Impact on Learning and Understanding</h2>

<p>If you had the opportunity to learn from a tutor, you would know how useful it is to be able to ask them questions and have them correct your issues. This is the true educational value you can get with AI to a much smaller extent. I use it for 
topics or concepts that I really want to learn and I find it useful.</p>

<h2 id="iv-practical-applications">IV Practical Applications</h2>

<p>You’re not going to be using AI to build AI or other projects. A wrench isn’t going to fix the car, the mechanic is.</p>

<h2 id="v-challenges-and-opportunities">V Challenges and Opportunities</h2>

<p>I found it challenging to have AI help as the course progressed further, however I found it had immense potential when it came to learning and finding solutions. These are however abstract and not concrete. A human brain is still needed to parse 
through the information.</p>

<h2 id="vi-comparative-analysis">VI Comparative Analysis</h2>

<p>All AI does is help you learn faster. I like to call it the devil’s tool, because while it can be useful for learning, it is equally tempting to fall into the trap of using it as a crutch.</p>

<h2 id="vii-future-considerations">VII Future Considerations</h2>

<p>AI won’t be replacing Software Engineers anytime in the future, but it will make them more efficient.</p>

<h2 id="viii-conclusion">VIII Conclusion</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, it is currently still a tool that has JUST emerged. The best thing we can do is to use it as such to help us accelerate our learning. That is, until it becomes powerful enough to truly disrupt industries and topple giants. 
But that’s not happening anytime soon. Right now it’ll remain a partner looking over my shoulder, and helping me catch my mistakes and pitfalls.</p>
