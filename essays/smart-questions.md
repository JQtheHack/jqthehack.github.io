### Eventually I'll Need It.

When I started learning how to program, I never really asked questions about anything. That's because everything that I ever could ask, was already answered. Whenever I had an issue I would take a visit to StackOverflow, Reddit, Youtube or even just some random website with some code on it. I've never truly needed to ask a problem about how to deal with anything since someone somewhere has already experienced the issue I'm currently having. However, as the course progresses I feel that that won't always be the case. Eventually, there will be a time when I won't be able to rely on the already available resources on the internet and I'll need some guidance to push forward on a problem.

### A Good & Bad Question

Being able stuck on a problem is normal, and everyone who has programmed for long enough can relate to this feeling. So as I read through Eric Raymond's "[How to ask questions the smart way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html#idm379)", I gained a greater awareness for the culture, and insight into why programmers react the way they do when it comes to answering questions. I respect the attention to detail, and I enjoyed learning about the 'correct' way to ask a question in one of these forums. 

For example, one particular example of a smart question is this forum post, named "[What are the effects of exceptions on performance in Java?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/299068/what-are-the-effects-of-exceptions-on-performance-in-java)". The user prior to posting his question has done the due diligence to simply do some research on his own. In the post the user brings up his google searches and the results from it aswell as offering some testing he's done to TRY and find an answer. As a result, the answers this user receives are equally thorough. On the other hand, in this post titled "[what's wrong with my java program?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20738332/whats-wrong-with-my-java-program)", you can see a stark difference in effort. This user provides absolutely no analysis, and frankly gives off the vibe that they don't care whatsoever given the title "what's wrong with my java program?". Clearly, the user does not care, and neither do the fellow programmers responding to the thread. This thread was eventually marked as closed due to demonstrating a minimal understanding of the problem.

Overall, it's very important to be able to distinguish what constitutes a "smart" question and what's a "not smart" question. A consistent theme I was able to learn is if you care and want to really dive deep and fix an issue, other  users will respond in kind.
