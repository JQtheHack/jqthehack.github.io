## Pace
The thing that I quickly learned about this class is that it's very fast! Having to quickly and efficiently do my work made me realize that I need to focus more. For this first WOD, I felt like it was quite an easy problem, however I quickly realized from doing the future practice WOD's that that won't always be the case. The very first problem felt more like a warmup than an actual real programming challenge, and although I haven't taken the second WOD yet, the practice WODs feel as if they are degrees harder.

I think that if I devote my time and energy to practicing more I'll be fine with any future WOD, however it's going to be a challenge since I've never had to learn someone new so quickly and be expected to competently solve programming problems after a few days or so. I do think that the experience was very valuable though. The WODs very closely mimic what's expected of you in a technical interview where you have to demonstrate programming skills in a short timeframe while still being close to what were learning, so it's kind of like killing 2 birds with 1 stone where we practice what we learn and practice a skill we will likely need in the future. Additionally, I feel it's important to discuss how you did on the WOD so you can do it better next time.

## Reflection & Future
Looking back on how I actually implemented the functions, I think I would try to make it more efficient when doing it the next time. In the moment, you have to focus on actually just finishing the assignment and getting the credit. But, eventually I'll have to start thinking about how to implement the same functions and ideas in a more efficient and easy to read fashion in order to hit my goals. I am up for that challenge, and I'm excited to see what other stuff I'll learn in this class.
