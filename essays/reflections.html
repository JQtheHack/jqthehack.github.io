  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Software engineering is vast. There are thousands of different tools available and when you feel you’ve learned it all, another tool emerges. With the constant evolution and introduction of new technologies, it is easy to be overwhelmed. However, 
despite the never-ending growing pile of new tools, there are always key fundamental concepts and tools that you’ll see never go away. Among them stands 2 fundamental software engineering concepts: Open Source Software Development and Coding 
Standards</p>

<h2 id="open-source-software-development">Open Source Software Development</h2>

<p>In my opinion, I feel that OSS Development takes the cake for the most impactful and useful topic to learn about. One of the tools that I’ve found lots of value in learning is GitHub which basically allows you to collaborate with other developers 
around the world. I’ve never used GitHub before, but I understand how immensely useful it is. Even knowing simple skills like how to push, pull, and 
update a project is substantially useful. The greatest benefit is being able to collaborate with others, and do so in a manner that is seamless and easy. Additionally, the ability to track changes was very useful for reverting changes.</p>

<h2 id="coding-standards">Coding Standards</h2>

<p>Another useful thing I’ve learned are standards for how your code should be structured. While it can be very annoying at times to fix these issues, it is essential to have a uniform standard for code in a large scale project. Without it, you’ll 
have disordered code with different kinds of coding standards and that can seem very messy because every developer will code things in their style. A standard makes code easier to read in the long run even if it’s a pain to implement. Also, it 
makes it easier to maintain and easier for new developers to contribute to the project.</p>
