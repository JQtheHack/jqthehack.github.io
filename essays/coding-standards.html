<h2 id="importance">Importance</h2>

<p>People come from many different areas and background with differing levels of experience, and as a result we think and do things differently. And so, a coding style helps lay down the law in terms of how we want our code to look. And while it can 
certainly be annoying having to care about little things like indentation, white space, or how your braces look, it can often have us dismissing the idea of using them in the first place. However, despite the annoyance a coding standard may provide, they are one of the many important aspects of successful software development.</p>

<h3 id="so-why">So Why?</h3>

<p>Coding standards are not just small cosmetic nuisances that you have to correct. They are a standard for how a team of developers must write and structure their code. Whilst some standards may seem pointless, many serve a critical role in 
consistency &amp; readability. Let’s imagine a scenario where you had to look through documentation on a topic you were interested in learning about. Now, what if for every section, it had a different font, font size, spacing, color, etc.. You could 
certainly still read it, however it would take a considerable amount of unecessary effort to deal with. You’d think to yourself “why couldn’t everything just be the same?”. That’s the same for programming as it is writing.</p>

<h2 id="my-impressions-of-coding-standards">My Impressions of Coding Standards</h2>

<p>After my first week of using ESLint, I find it painful to install and a pain to have. However, despite my initial grievances with having it setup, I believe that it will help anyone who wants to look over the programs I create, and in turn, help 
me read anyone else’s. Being forced into doing things one way, is the best way to ensure readable code, and it will help other people help you because they can key in on the source of your issues without needing to pour in unecessary time actually 
trying to read your code. While it may be a challenge for the individual, it is a boon for the group as a whole.</p>
