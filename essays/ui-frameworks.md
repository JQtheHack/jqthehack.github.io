## HTML & CSS

Prior to using frameworks, I used HTML & CSS for the past few weeks to do my webpages. I realized that it's quite a lot of work to set up, and you have to be very precise when you write your code. Using HTML and CSS, I noticed that it's much
harder to find errors in your code because it's very lenient compared to a programming language. The only point of feedback you have is to inspect the page, and fix it with trial and error. That's not as helpful to me compared to seeing an error
code and being able to resolve it more quickly. Another thing with HTML and CSS especially is the reuse of a lot of code. Sometimes, because a thing isn't working, you have to add random padding and margin to it. This can cause a lot of the same
code to be rewritten, and that's never a good thing when programming.

## Working With Bootstrap

When I saw the future WODS we were doing in my assignment, I thought it was incredibly ridiculous the amount of work we would be getting. However, once I really worked with a framework it wasn't anywhere near as bad as it seems. That's because
Bootstrap, the framework we use, provides lots of reusable bits of code that allows you to easily design webpages and implement functionality without being a ninja at HTML and CSS. I also really liked how easy it was to just add a few couple
lines of code and be able to use it very easily. The only downside with using Bootstrap was that there was an added complexity with learning how to design a webpage. That being that HTML & CSS is tied when you are using a framework. That
complicates bigger project because how do you debug styling errors if styling is done in both the HTML & CSS?

## Final Thoughts

Learning HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap has taught me how empowering it is to do front-end web development. I didn't believe I could so easily design something so similar to what a real website is using, but it's not as hard as I thought when
frameworks are involved. Bootstrap has really abstracted away most of the issues with using classic HTML & CSS and makes it much easier to quickly develop a webpage. I feel like I learned an incredibly useful skill for the future, despite it being
quite
brief. Understanding how it all works
underneath gives me
the ability and confidence to
read and
implement
changes when it
comes to
any webpage.
