## Why
Software Engineering has always been something that I can comfortably do. I always felt that this is something I would do since even in middle school, where I started programming at 14. However, despite me starting at a young age, it's not something that I have passion for or love to do in my free time (my true passion is sports/reading). I just found it as something I could do as a career.

## My Interests in Tech
Despite my indifferences, I do have some things that I find interesting in tech and programming in general. I like how the environment is always changing and shaping constantly. It's quite chaotic, and I enjoy it because there's always a sense of opportunity and there's always something new you can interact with and learn. Growing up and seeing the different pieces of tech grow exponentially has always made me want to go nearer to it, like a child yearning to see the fireworks, I also want to see the great technology to come.

## AI
The biggest thing I want to see grow and be apart of is AI. I believe it's going to be the next big thing in terms of exponentially changing the world around us, and I want to learn as much as I can about it going into the future. ChatGPT blew my mind the first time I used it, because it was so strange, it felt like magic. I wonder what I could discover in this new era of tech given the tools widely available. 

## Going Forward
My goal right now is to get my degree at UHM and hopefully work at a top tech company (like Google) developing software. I'd like to work with other incredible engineers on many different projects and hopefully some day go off on my own. In the end, Software Engineering is just the perfect means of which I can explore and discover, and fulfill my constant curiousity to learn new things.
