## Why
Software Engineering has always been something that I can comfortably do. I always felt that this is the path I would take since dating back to middle school, when I began programming at 14. However, despite me starting at a young age, it's not something that I have passion for or love to do in my free time (my true passion is sports and reading). I just found it as something I could do as a career.

## My Interests in Tech
Despite my indifferences, I do find that certain areas of tech and programming interesting. I like how the environment is always changing and evolving constantly. The chaos is something that appeals to me, as there's always a sense of opportunity and something new you can learn and discover. Witnessing the different cool pieces of tech grow exponentially growing up has always made me want to draw closer to it, much like a child yearning to see the fireworks. I want to witness the future advancements in technology.

## AI
The biggest thing I want to see is the growing expansion and integration of AI. I believe it's going to be the next big thing in terms of exponentially revolutionizing the world we live in, and I want to just gather as much knowledge as I can about it going into the future. ChatGPT blew my mind the first time I used it, because it just felt like 'magic'. I wonder what other 'magic' tricks I would be seeing in the future, and I'm also curious as to how they work. The future is truly unpredictable!

## Going Forward
Currently, my goal right now is to get my degree at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and ideally land a job at a top tech company (such as Google) developing software. I'd like to work with other incredible engineers on many different projects and hopefully, embark on my own journey in developing tech. Ultimately, Software Engineering serves as the perfect avenue for which I can delve deep into exploration and fulfill my unending curiosity to learn new things.
